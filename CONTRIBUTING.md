## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Clearviction Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openseattle/clearviction-next/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [contact@clearviction.org](contact@clearviction.org).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/openseattle/clearviction-next/wiki).
>
> Keep in mind, these guidelines apply to the _technical_ aspects of the [Clearviction website](https://clearviction.org/) and related projects. Questions about Clearviction's mission or about how to vacate a conviction in the state of Washington can be delivered via the [contact form](https://clearviction.org/contact) on our website.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- If you have access, create a thread in the `#cop-dev` channel of the Clearviction Slack.
- Open an [Issue/Bug Report](https://airtable.com/shrzTUdyiDQsnqR3K).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/openseattle/clearviction-next/wiki). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/openseattle/clearviction-next/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Web browser
  - Device type (Phone, tablet, or desktop/laptop)
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Severity of the issue
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [security@clearviction.org](security@clearviction.org).

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open a [Bug Report](https://airtable.com/shrzTUdyiDQsnqR3K).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked to be handled by the appropriate team. If the issue requires developer contribution, it will be labeled as such in Airtable and populate as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/openseattle/clearviction-next/issues)

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

<!-- ### Code Contributions
